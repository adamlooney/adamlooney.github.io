I am Director of the Marriner S. Eccles Institute for Economics and Quantitative Analysis at the University of Utah, clinical professor in the Division of Quantitative Analysis of Markets and Organizations, and a Visiting Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution.

My research examines the effects of government programs, with a particular focus on tax and student loan policy. While at Brookings and the University of Utah, I have been called to testify in Congress by members of both parties on tax and student loan policy, and my research has influenced the development of federal tax policies and education reforms.

I returned to Brookings in 2017 after three years of service in the U.S. Treasury Department as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis. At Treasury, I advised the Secretary on economic issues related to tax policy, analyzed current and proposed legislation, and provided the official receipts forecasts and revenue estimates for the Administration's budgets.

Prior to joining the Treasury, I was policy director of The Hamilton Project and was a senior fellow in Economic Studies at Brookings from 2010--2013. Previously, I served as the senior economist for public finance and tax policy with President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers and was an economist at the Federal Reserve Board. I received my Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University and my BA in economics from Dartmouth College.
